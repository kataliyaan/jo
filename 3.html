            <div class="tooltip">
                One of the things I love about her is that when I ask about her day or when she talks about it, 
                she doesn’t just say, "Okay lang." She always gives detailed answers. Everything that happened that day and how she felt—everything. And I really love that.

            <div class="tooltip">
                I admire her passion for what she does and her genuine desire to help people. A lot of people say, "I want to help others," when asked why they chose to become a doctor or a nurse. But with her, you can truly feel the sincerity. It’s not just words, she actually takes action and does something about it.

            <div class="tooltip">
                She has this ability to stay positive. No matter how bad a situation is, she always finds a way to turn it into something better, using it as motivation. And that’s something truly admirable about her.

            <div class="tooltip">
                She is really the best yapper. She never gives vague or generic answers. She shares her thoughts, emotions, and experiences in such a way that makes every conversation meaningful.

                Her soft heart. She may be strong, pero deep inside, she’s so caring and tender. She feels deeply for others, and that makes her even more special.
